// Can you explain the event loop in Node.js and how it differs from a traditional thread-based model?


/*

---- The event loop is implemented as a single-threaded loop that continuously checks the message queue 
     for new messages (also called events) to process. When a new message is added to the queue, 
     the event loop will execute the appropriate callback function associated with that message.

     This differs from traditional thread-based models where a separate thread is created for
     each incoming request, meaning that a thread will wait for the operation to complete before 
     continuing to execute.
