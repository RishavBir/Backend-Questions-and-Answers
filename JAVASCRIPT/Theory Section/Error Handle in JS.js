/*

1) Try and Catch Blocks : We can use try and catch blocks to handle the errors in javascript.
    We generally put our code that may throw exceptions in out try block and \
    code to handle the error in catch blocks.


    example:

    try {
            // code that may throw an exception
        } catch (error) {
                // code to handle the exception
            }
